It is possible to run Python code from RStudio, but there are known issues with [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/831) that complicate the setup.

One-time step: Install the development version of `reticulate`.

```{r install}
# remotes::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
```

Code setup: Use an `r` chunk to target your local python binary:

```{r setup}
reticulate::use_python("/Users/zach/opt/anaconda3/bin/python") # On my macbook
```

You can now create and run Python chunks!

```{python test}
import numpy as np
A = np.arange(9).reshape((-1, 3))
A
```
