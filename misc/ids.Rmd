title: "Using the ids package"

The [`ids` package](https://reside-ic.github.io/ids/) provides tools to create unique identifiers.

```{r setup}
library(ids)
```

Adjective-animal mode is my favorite! :D

This is affected by the random seed, and one can set max word lengths for both the adjective and animal:

```{r}
set.seed(101)
adjective_animal(10, max_len = c(6, 8))
```
